Development started: 1 Jul 2025; Release: TBD; Last updated: Probably within the last few days

A strategy-focused turn-based RPG where you train monsters to fight for you, with perfect information and no RNG or
grinding. Features a story about how trauma influences your perception, how much pain you'll put up with to love
someone, what it means to be "special", and how to keep on living when nothing matters anymore. Very early in
development, but progress is good
